# SST-
A Transformer-based Method for Correcting Daily SST Numerical Forecasting products

## Project Description:

This project proposes a Transformer-based method for revising daily sea surface temperature (SST) numerical forecast products. Traditional SST forecasting methods usually face problems such as model errors and insufficient observational data, etc. This project adopts the advanced Transformer structure and combines spatio-temporal features for data revision and accuracy improvement. With this method, it aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of numerical forecast products, especially in the fields of marine environment monitoring, climate prediction and navigation safety, which have a wide range of application prospects.
