# SST-
A Transformer-based Method for Correcting Daily SST Numerical Forecasting products

## Project Description:

This project presents a Transformer-based approach for correcting daily sea surface temperature (SST) numerical forecast products. Traditional SST forecasting methods often suffer from model errors and limited observational data. By leveraging the advanced Transformer architecture and integrating spatio-temporal features, this approach aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of numerical forecasts. The method holds significant potential for applications in marine environment monitoring, climate prediction, and navigation safety.
